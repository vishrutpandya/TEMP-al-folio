## Biography

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Astronomy, Astrophysics and Space Engineering (DAASE) at the Indian Institute of Technology Indore. I joined IIT Indore as an Assistant Professor in May 2018 and was promoted to Associate Professor in November 2022. I received my Ph.D. in Physics (Cosmology) from IIT Kharagpur in April 2013 under the supervision of Prof. Somnath Bharadwaj and Prof. Sugata Pratik Khastgir.

Before joining IIT Indore, I worked as a Research Associate in the Astrophysics Group at Imperial College London (2015–2018) with Prof. Jonathan R. Pritchard, and as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stockholm University (2012–2015) in the group of Prof. Garrelt Mellema.

I am a member of several international collaborations on the Epoch of Reionization, including SKA, LOFAR, and SKA-India. I am the PI of multiple externally funded research projects.
