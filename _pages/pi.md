## Biography


I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Astronomy, Astrophysics and Space Engineering (DAASE) at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore. I have joined IIT Indore as an Assistant Professor in May 2018. I have been promoted to the position of Associate Professor in November 2022. I have received my Ph.D. (Apr, 2013) degree in physics (cosmology) from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, under the supervision of Prof. Somnath Bharadwaj and Prof. Sugata Pratik Khastgir. Before joining at IIT Indore, I was a Research Associate in the Astrophysics Group at Imperial College London, UK (Nov, 2015 - April, 2018). At Imperial, I have worked in the research group of Prof. Jonathan R. Pritchard. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University (Dec, 2012 - Nov, 2015) and worked in the research group of Prof. Garrelt Mellema.

I am a member of the “Epoch of Reionization and the Dark Ages” international science working group for the SKA. I am also a member of the “Epoch of Reionization” science working group for the LOFAR International Telescope and the “Square Kilometre Array - India” collaboration for the “Cosmic Dwan and the Epoch of Reionization”. I am a long term visitor in the Astrophysics Group at Imperial College London, UK and in the Astroparticle Physics Group at SISSA, Trieste, Italy. I am PI of several ongoing externally funded research projects.
